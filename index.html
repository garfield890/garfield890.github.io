      <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Anay Agrawal</strong> and I am a freshman studying <strong>computer engineering</strong> at Cal Poly SLO.</p> 
      <p>I love tackling challenging problems and building cool projects that can make a tangible impact on other people. Outside of academics, I like to watch 
        sports (Formula 1 and basketball), go on hikes, and read books.</p>
